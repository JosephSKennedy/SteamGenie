This hack goes through your Steam Wishlist and evaluates what your next purchase should be.

The current heuristic is as follows: For each game in your wishlist, Wishlist_Ranking * Game_Price. Then, buy the game with the lowest value.

The steamapiwrapper project is used for its Python wrapper of the Steam API 


To be added:
	Additional heuristic
	Looking through a friend's or friends' wishlists
	Adding a budget?
